#Task description
#An integer N is given, representing the area of some rectangle.
#
#The area of a rectangle whose sides are of length A and B is A * B, and the perimeter is 2 * (A + B).
#
#The goal is to find the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area equals N. The sides of this rectangle should be only integers.
#
#For example, given integer N = 30, rectangles of area 30 are:
#
#(1, 30), with a perimeter of 62,
#(2, 15), with a perimeter of 34,
#(3, 10), with a perimeter of 26,
#(5, 6), with a perimeter of 22.
#Write a function:
#
#def solution(N)
#
#that, given an integer N, returns the minimal perimeter of any rectangle whose area is exactly equal to N.
#
#For example, given an integer N = 30, the function should return 22, as explained above.
#
#Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#
#N is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
