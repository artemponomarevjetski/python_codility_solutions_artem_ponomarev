#Task description
#A string S consisting of N characters is considered to be properly nested if any of the following conditions is true:
#
#S is empty;
#S has the form "(U)" or "[U]" or "{U}" where U is a properly nested string;
#S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
#For example, the string "{[()()]}" is properly nested but "([)()]" is not.
#
#Write a function:
#
#def solution(S)
#
#that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.
#
#For example, given S = "{[()()]}", the function should return 1 and given S = "([)()]", the function should return 0, as explained above.
#
#Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#
#N is an integer within the range [0..200,000];
#string S consists only of the following characters: "(", "{", "[", "]", "}" and/or ")".
